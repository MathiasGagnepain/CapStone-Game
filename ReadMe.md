# CAPSTONE - ESCAPE THE DUNGEON !

CapStone is a die and retry game created to test my skills on C Language it's not planned to update it to a real game.

The gameplay is simple, find a way to the boss and kill him to exit the dungeons (simple screenplay but the goals isn't to create the best game, just to pratice C, the story is optional), by default the player spawn at the middle of the dungeon and need to find a handmap to be able to know the right ways to the boss, basically I will add the [map here](capstone-map.png) but if you look it you are a **CHEATER !!!** Seriously if you play it for fun try to do it without the map, if you are just here to discover the gameplay or the test the maximum capacity of my game feel free to us the map to help you.

For now it's impossible to complete the game but if you clear all the corridor of the maze without be killed we can imagine you win, but warning to the **DEAD CORRIDOR**.

### MAP LEGEND:
- P - Player (YOU)
- $ - Loots
- ■ - Teleporter
- N - NPC (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- ☢ - Final Boss (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
